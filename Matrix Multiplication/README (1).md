# 🧮 Matrix Multiplication Project

This project demonstrates matrix multiplication from scratch in Python and verifies the results using NumPy. It reinforces core linear algebra concepts that are foundational in AI and deep learning.

## 📁 Files

- `matrix_multiplication.py` – Python script for matrix multiplication and validation.

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

- How to multiply two matrices manually
- NumPy's efficient matrix operations
- Comparing manual vs. library-based implementations

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

Install NumPy (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
python matrix_multiplication.py
```

## ✅ Output

- Manual matrix multiplication result
- NumPy's result
- Confirmation whether both results match
